## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to get more information for W. Avy about the temperature trends in Oahu for the months of June and December. The goal is to determine if the surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round.
## Results
* We can see from our analysis that in the month of June there is an average temperature of 74.9, with a max/min of 85.00 and 64.00. With 1700 data points we can safely say that the information correctly represents typical weather in June as seen below.

* Another observation we can make from our analysis is the data taken for December temperatures. In December we see an average temperature of 71.04 with a max/min of 83.00 and 56.00 degrees. December has slightly fewer data points at 1517 days then June but is still sufficient enough to confidently use the data as an indicator.

* We see in our comparison of June and December weather that there is only an average difference of 4 degrees between the two months, as well as a slightly higher standard deviation in December.

## Summary
The data from our analysis has shown us that there is not much of a difference in temperature between June and December, this shows us that the surf and ice cream business can be sustainable all year-round. An additional query that could be helpful in getting a better understand of weather in Oahu would be to analyze the precipitation throughout each month to make sure that surfing weather stays consistant. Another query that would help investors build confidence in the project is running an analysis on the most active station during December and June to insure that the data is consistant.
